# flutter caching test

This app shows how to cache data into File. 

Only works for mobile devices (not web-app).

Next stage will be caching data into database (SQLite). Hopefully it will support web-app as well.

To run program:
- ```git clone https://github.com/smartforce-io/flutter-caching.git```
- open "flutter-caching" folder in IDE
- ```flutter pub get``` (to install all dependencies)
- choose a device
- run "main.dart" in debug mode
